# Getting Started with Create React App

Clone the repository and then run npm install (FYI: I used node version 16.0.0 you can switch to this version if you get an error when set up).

### What I Did, Why and How to make it run locally ?

Clone the repository and then run npm install (FYI: I used node version 16.0.0 you can switch to this version if you get an error when set up).

This only consists of the PIN verification UI as a MODAL. I Implement it with responsive behavior for both (Desktop and Mobile)

I have used “13456” as the PIN value to test this it has been hard coded. So You may change the value and test different scenarios.

I have implemented minimum requirements and plus points too (I was able to implement only one test scenario, I’m not more comfortable with unit testing but yeasI’m working on them.)

npm start will start the app locally. (I used create-react-app to build the project)

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
